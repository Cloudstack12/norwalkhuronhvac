                    Not only will keeping your home healthy during a Dust Storm be beneficial in itself, but it may also prevent additional damages down the road. When airflow is restricted by particulate matter (dust), it becomes difficult for indoor air conditioning units to remove moisture or heat from the air. This results in higher energy bills due to inefficient cooling or overheating, and it could even lead to structural damage if enough moisture accumulates inside an indoor enclosure like an AC unit.

                <h2>THE IMPORTANCE OF AIR QUALITY AND KEEPING YOUR HOME CLEAN</h2>
            </section>
            <section>
                Keeping your home clean is important for several reasons. Not only does it improve the air quality, but it also reduces the spread of bacteria and other harmful particles. In addition, keeping your home clean can make it more comfortable to live in – dust mites are attracted to dirty environments, and they can cause allergies and asthma problems in people who are sensitive to them. Finally, a clean home environment looks nicer and feels more inviting than an unclean one.
            <p></p>
                <section><p> Norwalk HVAC understands the importance of air quality and keeping your home clean during a dust storm. By tracking energy usage and recognizing when dust levels increase, we can take appropriate action to improve air quality and keep your family safe. Not only will this help reduce the risk of respiratory illness, it will also help reduce the amount of dust that accumulates, which is vital for improving air quality. Keep your home clean by regularly cleaning all surfaces and removing any clutter that may be blocking airflow.</p>

                        <h2>HOW TO MAINTAIN PROPER AIRFLOW IN YOUR HOME DURING A DUST STORM </h2>
                    </section>
                    <section>
                        During a dust storm, the air inside your home can become increasingly dusty and thick with pollen. This can make it difficult to breathe and stay healthy.
                    <p></p><section>
                        <p>Here are some tips on how to maintain proper airflow in your home during a dust storm:</p>
                        <p>-Open all doors and windows as much as possible, especially if you have children or pets who are sensitive to allergens.</p>
                        <p>-Keep fans constantly running throughout the house (and turn them up high), unless you have an allergy that requires you to keep the fan off.</p>
                        <p>-If you need to sleep indoors, try sleeping in a completely closed room instead of an open one. The humidity will help reduce the number of dust particles that reach your throat/nose.</p>
                        <p>-If using electronic devices is important for you, try keeping them turned OFF when conditions outside are bad for visibility or health reasons.</p>
                        <p>
                            The best way to maintain proper airflow in your home during a dust storm is to seal all cracks and openings that allow dust, dirt, and other particles inside. This will help keep the humidity levels low and minimize the likelihood of asthma attacks or other respiratory problems. You can also install ducts or filters to remove harmful allergens before they reach your indoor environment. Finally, make sure you have adequate supplies on hand (such as masks and talcum powder) in case of an emergency.

                        -Wash all windows and screens.
                    <p></p><section>
                        <p>-Clean the air conditioning filters.</p>
                        <p>-Trim trees and branches that are overhanging your home or blocking sunlight/vents.</p>
                        <p>-Pump out water containers close to your home.</p>
                        <p>-Check for and fix any leaks.</p>
                        <p>-Empty the trash regularly, especially if your home is in a low area.</p>
                        <p>-Close all vents in the attic and on the roof.</p>
                        <p>-Remove all objects from the exterior of your home that could be swept away in a large windstorm.</p>
                        <p>When it comes to cleaning your home in advance of a storm, there are a few key things to keep in mind. First and foremost, make sure that all windows and doors are closed tight. This will help reduce the amount of airflow into the house, which can cause damage. Also, be sure to shut off electricity to essential appliances (like the refrigerator), so they won’t start up again during the storm and create more noise or messes. Finally, don’t forget to clean any surfaces that could potentially catch water (windowsills, porches, roofs).</p>
